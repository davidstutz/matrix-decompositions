# Common Matrix Decompositions Demonstrated in PHP

Throughout the first course of Numerical Analysis at the RWTH Aachen University I tried some matrix decompositions in PHP and based on the Slim framework I developed a small demonstration website - this project.

The demonstration application can be found here: [http://davidstutz.de/matrix-decompositions/matrix-decompositions](http://davidstutz.de/matrix-decompositions/matrix-decompositions). My personal blog can be found at [http://davidstutz.de/](http://davidstutz.de/).

Consider [donating](https://davidstutz.de/donate/) to support development.
